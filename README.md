# Andrew's Digital Garden
Welcome to my digital garden! This digital garden was created recently to help me work in public during my 50 Projects in 50 Days Challenge. 

I hope you find it interesting and useful in your programming, business, design, or whatever journey you embark on!

# To Get Started With Your Own Digital Garden
You will want to use [this repository by oleeskild](https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden) to deploy your template. You will then add in your tokens and such as the instructions say on his GitHub Repository (I will come back and elaborate on this later - gotta step out real quick).
