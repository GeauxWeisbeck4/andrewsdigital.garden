# Wednesday
- It is the day after Valentine's Day... and that's it. What? Was I supposed to say something romantic or sexy? Y'all are crazy - Valentine's Day is just another corporate excuse for tricking Americans into believing that money buys love and that you need to go spend an exorbant amount of money to make your lover happy and that there is no way they will be happy without some fucking candy or some other stupid shit.
- Lisa and I almost got kicked out of our hotel room again - talk about a romantic evening for Valentines Day....
	- Yeah we totally didn't fight or nothing either after that....
- Anyways - fuck it. I think we're moving from this sorry ass town though. We're just sick of it. Packing up and hitting the road to somewhere new for both of us I think. God damn. Oh well tune in while I finish my first project that I've been trying to do since Superbowl Sunday!
