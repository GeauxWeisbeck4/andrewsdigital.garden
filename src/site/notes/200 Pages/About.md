# About Andrew
- Hey y'all! I'm a freelance full stack developer currently living in Raleigh, NC. 
- Currently enjoying the freelance life but open to new opportunities, especially collaboration opportunites.
- Have a fiance - Lisa - who is my best friend and my hero. She gets up everyday to help those afflicted by the opioid epidemic with a smile on her face. Well, maybe not always a smile in the morning, but she is very empathetic towards participants and is super passionate about harm reduction - see [North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition](https://nchrc.org)
- We have been homeless since the middle of January and intend on moving here very shortly
