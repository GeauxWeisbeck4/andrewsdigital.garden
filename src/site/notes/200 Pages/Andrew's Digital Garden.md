#### Welcome to my digital garden, created with Obsidian and GitHub! I am so happy you stopped by to check out what I've been cultivating. Let me help you get your bearings around here.

You will find the three main sections of my digital garden below:

## 1. [[Catalog of Notes\|Catalog of Notes]]
- Here you will find all of my notes categorized under various subjects according to their topics. Always a fantastic place to start if you want to just peruse through what I've got. 
## 2. [[My Journal\|My Journal]] 
- This is more of a "Dev Diary" or "Entrepreneur's Daily Accounting", rather than my personal diary with cute little heart lock on it. I talk about what I have worked on for the day, what I accomplished, if I was productive, and so forth. Keeps track of my progress alongside my daily work.
## 3. [[The Garden Post Blog\|The Garden Post Blog]]
- You will find my long form notes (aka "Articles") display on the Garden Post, a digital garden post that I slap my blog posts onto for the world to read and judge. They are sort of the final cultivation of initial seedlings that started as a confused little "Hello World?" note.

I've always thought that Digital Gardens were such a cool idea, but I don't think I understood the concept of working in public and mostly kept mine private-ish. Andrew's Digital Garden intends to change that for myself and to start building things in the eye of potential future clients and project collaborators. 

Each gardener may choose to write about a set of topics they are trying to cultivate into something potentially bigger - I choose to write about almost anything, but try to gravitate my ideas around [[Web Development\|Web Development]], [[Entrepreneurship\|Entrepreneurship]], and [[Psychology\|Psychology]]. I suspect that this will change over time. 

Want a recommendation on where to get started with each topic? Start with these and work your way up the knowledge tree!
