- ## Home of Andrew's Svelte Notes
	- ### What is Svelte?
		- Svelte is a tool for building web applications. Like other user interface frameworks, it allows you to build your app _declaratively_ out of components that combine markup, styles and behaviours.
		- These components are _compiled_ into small, efficient JavaScript modules that eliminate overhead traditionally associated with UI frameworks.
		- You can build your entire app with Svelte (for example, using an application framework like [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)), or you can add it incrementally to an existing codebase. You can also ship components as standalone packages that work anywhere.
