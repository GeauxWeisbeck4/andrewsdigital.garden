		- About Jonas from his Udemy description:
			- Hi, I'm Jonas! I have been identified as one of Udemy's Top Instructors and all my premium courses have earned the best-selling status for outstanding performance and student satisfaction.
			- I'm a full-stack web developer and designer with a passion for building beautiful things from scratch. I've been building websites and apps since 2010 and also have a Master's degree in Engineering.
			- I discovered my passion for teaching and helping others by sharing all I knew when I was in college, and that passion brought me to Udemy in 2015.
			- Here, in all my courses, what students love the most is that I take the time to explain every concept in a way that everyone can easily understand.
			- **_So, do you want to learn how to build awesome websites with modern HTML and CSS?_**
			- **_Looking for a complete JavaScript course that takes you from zero to an advanced developer?_**
			- **_Or maybe you want to build modern and fast back-end applications with Node.js?_**
			- Then don't waste your time with random tutorials or incomplete youtube videos. All my courses are easy-to-follow, all-in-one packages that will take your skills to the next level.These courses are exactly the courses I wish I had when I was first getting into web development!. So see for yourself, enroll in one of my courses (or all of them :D) and join **1,000,000+** happy students today.
