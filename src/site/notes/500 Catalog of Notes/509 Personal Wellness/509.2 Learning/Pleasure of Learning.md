# Summary: Pleasure of learning
-   human brain naturally tunes in to "interesting information" in the environment
-   learning and discovering new things is rewarding
-   many educators subscribe to the dangerous myth that learning may cause displeasure and still be effective
-   surprisal is highly valued in new knowledge acquisition
-   predictability and surprisal may both add to attractiveness of the information channel
-   attractiveness of the information channel depends on the prior knowledge
-   information delivered to the brain must account for prior knowledge. This factor makes universal delivery, e.g. via lecturing, very difficult
-   attractiveness of the information channel depends on the speed of delivery and the speed of processing
-   the speed and complexity of information delivery in learning must to tailored to individual needs
-   the encoding of a new high value associative memory occurs simultaneously with sending a signal to reward centers in the brain
-   failed tailoring of information channels in schooling leads to lack of reward
-   learning provides a unique type of sustainable pleasure that may have therapeutic value
-   for systemic reasons, schooling usually fails to tune in to child interests
-   unrewarding nature of schooling is the chief cause of near-universal dislike of "learning" at school
-   by destroying the pleasure of learning we contribute to creating an unhappy society
-   the fundamental law of declarative learning states:Â **No pleasure, no learning!**
