- # 1. Have a calming influence.
    - Enjoy your interaction and allow your calm aura to relax those around you.
- # 2. Quit habits that bring you shame.
    - "Much of our sense of confidence is developed in moments when we needn't perform. We create an identity when we do things that make us feel bad about ourselves. A poor self-image will flood into all areas of life. Live well and with pride, and you will exude an attractive energy."
- # 3. Listen beyond the words.
    - Set yourself apart by listening.
- # 4. Reveal less about you.
    - Be mysterious.
- # 5. Open up physically.
    - Drop your shoulders, loosen up physically, and take up more space.
- # 6. Soften your face.
    - Just a light smile will do.
- # 7. Make others look important.
    - Insecure people highlight faults in others. Attractive leaders forget themselves and make others look and feel great.
- # 8. Slow your movements.
    - Being slow demonstrates emotional control and status while calming you down, so you think more clearly.
- # 9. Ask a question few others ask.
    - Show curiosity for others.
- # 10. Ignore complaining, drama, and disrespect.
    - Steer conversations back to positivity.
