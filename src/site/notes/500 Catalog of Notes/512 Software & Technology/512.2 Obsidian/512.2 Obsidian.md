- I wanted to find an easy solution to get my digital garden out on the web since there is so much awesome stuff on here. I decided to throw down 20 bones on the Obsidian Publishing subscription to see how much I like my site - or not.
- Let's get to the whole process though

## Customizing site
- Customize the site by publishing the following to website - they won't appear in the file explorer but will in the publish changes dialog
	- `publish.css` to add custom css
	- `publish.js` to add custom JavaScript
	- `favicon-32x32.png` for favicon
- Must use another application to create the CSS and JavaScript files
- Must set up a custom domain to add javascript

## Use Community Theme
	1.  Open your vault in the default file explorer for your OS.
	2.  Go to the vault settings folder (default: `.obsidian`).
	3.  Open the `themes` folder.
	4.  Copy the CSS file for the theme you want to use for your site.
	5.  Paste the file into the root folder of your vault.
	6.  Rename the CSS file to `publish.css`.
	7.  [Publish](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Publish+and+unpublish+notes#Publish%20notes) `publish.css`.`

## Enable UI Features
- You can toggle several UI features for your site, such as the graph view or a table of contents.
- Browse the available UI features under the **Reading experience** and **Components** sections in the [site options](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Manage+sites#View%20site%20options)

# Managing Sites
- ## Create a new Site
1.  In ribbon, to the left of the application window, click **Publish changes** (paper plane icon).
2.  If you already have an existing site, click **Switch site** (arrows icon).
3.  In **Site ID**, enter the path you want for your site. For example, a site with the ID `my-amazing-site` is available from publish.obsidian.md/my-amazing-site.
4.  Click **Create**.

# Publish and Unpublish Notes
- ### Publish Notes
	1.  In ribbon, to the left of the application window, click **Publish changes** (paper plane icon).
	2.  In the **Publish changes** dialog, click **NEW** to see all the notes you haven't published yet.
	3.  Select the notes you want to publish.
	4.  Click **Publish**.
- ### Unpublish Notes
	1.  In ribbon, to the left of the application window, click **Publish changes** (paper plane icon).
	2.  In the **Publish changes** dialog, click **UNCHANGED** to see all your published notes.
	3.  Select the notes you want to unpublish.
	4.  Click **Publish**.
## Update a published note

1.  In ribbon, to the left of the application window, click **Publish changes** (paper plane icon).
2.  In the **Publish changes** dialog, click **CHANGED** to see all the notes that have been changed since the last time they were published.
3.  Select the notes you want to update.
4.  Click **Publish**.

## Publish linked notes

Publishing notes that have links to other notes results in broken links unless you publish the linked notes as well. Obsidian Publish can help you by selecting notes that are linked from the notes that are already selected.

To select all linked notes, click **Add linked** in the **Publish changes** dialog.

Review the updated selection to make sure it doesn't include any notes that you're not ready to publish yet.

## Automatically select notes to publish

To automatically select a note to be published, set `publish: true` in the [YAML front matter](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter) for the note.

## Ignore notes

To ignore a note in Obsidian Publish, set `publish: false` in the [YAML front matter](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter) for the note.

The note no longer shows up in the list of notes to publish.

Set up a custom domain

You can set up a custom domain or subdomain for your [Obsidian Publish](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Introduction+to+Obsidian+Publish) site.

We don't yet have a way to provision SSL certificate on your behalf. If you want to enable HTTPS for a custom domain, you either need to use your own proxy or create a site on CloudFlare.

## Set up using CloudFlare

The easiest way to set up a custom domain or subdomain is to create a [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com/) account and let CloudFlare manage your domain's DNS.

When you migrate to CloudFlare, you automatically keep all your existing DNS setup, including your subdomains, email service, and hosting services. Using CloudFlare can speed up your websites and add SSL to your sites for free.

Typically, users host their Obsidian Publish content on a root domain (e.g. `mysite.com`) or an immediate subdomain (e.g. `notes.mysite.com`).

**CloudFlare:**

1.  Open Cloudflare to the domain you wish to add Publish to, such as `mysite.com`, even if you want a subdomain like `notes.mysite.com`.
2.  Go to **DNS** and click **Add Record**.
3.  Select **CNAME**
4.  In **name**, enter your domain or subdomain, for example `notes.mysite.com`.
5.  In **target**, enter `publish-main.obsidian.md`. Don't include your personal sub-URL in this value. Obsidian Publish handles this from your configuration.
6.  Go to **SSL/TLS** and set the SSL/TLS encryption mode to "Full" to configure the SSL/TLS certificate automatically.

**Note:** To redirect both `mysite.com` and `www.mysite.com` to Obsidian Publish, you need to create a [Page Rule](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172336-Creating-Page-Rules) with the following settings:

-   URL match: `www.mysite.com/*`
-   Foward URL - 301 Permanent Redirect
-   Redirect URL: `https://mysite.com/$1`

Once you create the page rule, you should also create a CNAME record for `www.mysite.com` just like you created for `mysite.com`

**Obsidian:**

1.  In ribbon, to the left of the application window, click **Publish changes** (paper plane icon).
2.  In the **Publish changes** dialog, click **Change site options** (cog icon).
3.  Next to **Custom domain**, click **Configure**.
4.  In **Custom URL**, enter the URL to your domain or subdomain.

**Note:**: If your custom domain setup ends up in a redirect loop, it's likely that the encryption mode in CloudFlare has been set to "Flexible" instead of "Full".

## Set up using a proxy

If you want to host your own web server and set up your own SSL encryption, you can choose this option.

If you are already hosting a website under your domain or subdomain, you can also use this option and set up your website to load your Obsidian Publish site under a specific URL path, instead of hosting the full site.

Proxy all requests under that URL path to `https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/...` and **configure the site options in Obsidian to the same URL path** by setting **Custom URL** to `mysite.com/my-notes`.

You can also set up Obsidian Publish as a sub-URL of a site you own. For example, `https://mysite.com/my-notes/`. To achieve this, you must host your own server and proxy all requests to our server at `https://publish.obsidian.md/`.

### NGINX

In your NGINX configuration, add the following:

```nginx
location /my-notes {
  proxy_pass https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/;
  proxy_ssl_server_name on;
}
```

### Apache

In `.htaccess`, add the following:

```htaccess
RewriteEngine  on
RewriteRule    "^my-notes/(.*)$"  "https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/$1"  [L,P]
```

**Note:** `mod_rewrite` must be enabled, and you may also need to configure [SSLProxyEngine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40938148/reverse-proxy-for-external-url-apache)

### Netlify

```
[[redirects]]
  from = "https://mysite.com/my-notes/*"
  to = "https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
```

### Vercel

In `vercel.json`, [configure rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/configuration#project/rewrites):

```json
{
  ...

  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/my-notes/",
      "destination": "https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes"
    },
    {
      "source": "/my-notes/:path*",
      "destination": "https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/:path*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Caddy

```
mysite.com {
	encode zstd gzip
	handle /my-notes* {
		reverse_proxy https://publish.obsidian.md {
			header_up Host {upstream_hostport}
		}
		rewrite * /serve?url=mysite.com{path}
	}
}
```

### Supported HTTP X-Headers

If your proxy service doesn't allow query paths, you can use `https://publish.obsidian.md/` with a custom header `x-obsidian-custom-domain` set to your site URL `mysite.com/my-subpath`.

## Redirect old site to custom domain

If you want to redirect your visitors from the old `publish.obsidian.md` site to your new custom domain, enable the **Redirect to your custom domain** option when configuring your custom domain.

## Troubleshoot

Once you set up your custom domain, if you've visited your site from your previous `https://publish.obsidian.md/slug` link, you may have to clear your browser cache for certain things (like fonts, graphs, or password access) to work properly. This is due to the cross-domain security restrictions that are imposed by modern browsers. The good news is that readers of your site should never run into issue this if you only let visitors use your custom domain.

### Set up Google Analytics

To enable Google Analytics for your Obsidian Publish site:

1.  In ribbon, to the left of the application window, click **Publish changes** (paper plane icon).
2.  In the **Publish changes** dialog, click **Change site options** (cog icon).
3.  In **Google Analytics tracking code**, enter your tracking code.
