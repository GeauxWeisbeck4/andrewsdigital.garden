- ### Excerpt from **Full Stack JS Development**
    - While Node was invading the server space, another movement was gathering pace in the world of databases. For years, the primary method of working with data stores had been to issue SQL queries to relational databases. Yet there’s another type of data store that doesn’t rely on SQL. This class of database, known as NoSQL, doesn’t even use the familiar table structures of relational databases. NoSQL databases store data in a variety of formats, such as documents or key-value pairs, and are less rigid and structured than relational databases. This lack of structure often leads to simpler prototyping and ease of development. NoSQL databases tend to be slightly faster, as there’s no need for them to enforce the rigid table structure of relational databases.
    - In 2007, a company named 10gen (now MongoDB, Inc.) began working on a NoSQL database that would become a component in a planned platform as a service (PaaS) offering. In 2009, the database known as MongoDB (a play on the word hu**mongo**us) was open sourced. MongoDB is a document-oriented database that stores information as Binary JSON (BSON) documents. By using a flavor of JSON, Mongo is incredibly simple to read and write objects from JavaScript code. Just as Node replaces another server-side language with JavaScript, MongoDB replaces SQL with queries based on JavaScript objects.
